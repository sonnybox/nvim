Note: I wasn't kidding about using it. If you do end up using it, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.
1. All LSPs are configured manually.
2. Install the following dependencies:
'''
git unzip wget curl gzip tar bash sh python node go cargo npm pip tree-sitter cc (or gcc clang cl zig) ripgrep fd
'''
3. Review all configuration files, all keymaps are made just for me, you probably prefer something different.
